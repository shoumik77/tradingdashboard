    A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by
    cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit
    or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks
    based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by
    a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies
    is that they are generally not issued by any central authority,
    rendering them theoretically immune to government interference
    or manipulation. [Source: Investopedia]

    This class provides information about the cryptocurrencies available as
